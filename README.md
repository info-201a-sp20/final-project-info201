## Domain of Interest

### Climate Change:

Our topic of interest is climate change. We are interested in this topic because it is very relevant and has been a hot topic for several years now. The recent events of the coronavirus have also made a great impact in the field of climate change. This is a very crucial topic that may affect this world for generations to come.

### Other examples of data driven projects related to this domain:
- [Temperature Analysis](https://github.com/LeonHackl/DataScience-ClimateChange) is a project that analyzes the change in land temperature in specific countries over the last 250+ years.

- [Climate Change Data Visualization](https://github.com/aditimallavarapu/Cs-424-Project-2) is an extensive project that looks into the data visualization of global warming through data on temperature, energy consumption, and carbon emissions from 1965 to 2013 for several countries around the world.

- [Poland Climate Change](https://github.com/olakraso/Climate_change) is a project that analyzes the climate change in Poland based on the data from various meteorological stations over a span of 70 years.


### Data-driven questions we hope to answer about this domain:
- Can a positive change in climate change be seen due to corona and people staying indoors more? (analysis of climate change during recent months can answer this question)
- Which factors have impacted sea levels in the world's oceans and in what ways? How much have sea levels risen? (comparison of data for factors of sea leavels can answer this question)
- Is there a significant increase in CO2 emissions in the atmosphere in the last 50 years? Is there a change at all? (analysis of CO2 emission data over last 50 years can answer this question)
- How has climate change affected the world so far? (analysis of result factors of climate change can answer this question)
- What countries are impacted? Are some countries impacted more than others? (comparison of country data related to climate change can answer this question)


## Finding Data

### Source 1:
- Data downloaded from: [Sea Levels](https://datahub.io/core/sea-level-rise) (web URL)
- This data was collected from the US Environmental Protection Agency using data from CSIRO, 2015; NOAA, 2015 and contains “cumulative changes in sea level for the world’s oceans since 1880, based on a combination of long-term tide gauge measurements and recent satellite measurements. It shows average absolute sea level change, which refers to the height of the ocean surface, regardless of whether nearby land is rising or falling. Satellite data are based solely on measured sea level, while the long-term tide gauge data include a small correction factor because the size and shape of the oceans are changing slowly over time.
- Number of Observations (Rows): 135
- Number of Features (Columns): 4
- Questions that can be answered: 
  - How has climate change affected the world so far?
  - How much have sea levels risen?

### Source 2:
- Data downloaded from: [Global Temperature](https://datahub.io/core/global-temp) (web URL)
- This data was gathered from two separate sources. The GISTEMP Global Land-Ocean Temperature Index provided combined land-surface air and sea-surface water temperature information. In other words this information provided an estimate of global surface temperature change. This information is updated monthly using current data files from “NOAA GHCN v4 (meteorological stations), and ERSST v5 (ocean areas)”. The second source comes from the NOAA National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) and International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS). These combined sources provide information about global land and ocean temperature irregularity.
- Number of Observations(Rows): 3,289
- Number of Features (Columns): 5 (combined)
- Questions that can be answered:
  - Which factors have impacted sea levels in the world's oceans and in what ways?
  - How has climate change affected the world so far?

### Source 3:
- Data downloaded from: [Glacier Size](http://datahub.io/core/glacier-mass-balance) (web URL)
- This data was gathered from two different sources: US EPA and the World Glacier Monitoring Service (WGMS). Together, these two sources provided the average cumulative mass balance of “reference” glaciers worldwide from 1945-2014. To show the changes in the average thickness of the glacier, the measurements are provided in meters of water equivalent. Ultimately, the data shows the change in this mass balance over the years.
- Number of Observations(Rows): 70
- Number of Features (Columns): 3
- Questions that can be answered:
  - Which factors have impacted sea levels in the world's oceans and in what ways?
  - How has climate change affected the world so far?
