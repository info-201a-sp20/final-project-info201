       in the top ten emitting countries in 2014 has been solid fuel. This being the most up to date information about the
       fuel that contributes the most to carbon emissions confirms that to change these patterns this is the fuel that needs 
       to be targeted as it is seen through the most recent data. Of these top ten countries; China, the United States, 
       and India tend to be the highest at using solid fuels to emit carbon into the atmosphere. This could be due to
       the fact that both India, China, and US are highly populated countries that need a large supply of fuel to meet the need, 
       therefore they have resided to the most easy to access and least expensive source of fossil fuel. Of these top ten 
       countries emitting the most carbon, the top five countries whose has the highest rate of total change in fossil 
       fuel use continues to be China and the United States. This essentially indicates that these two countries emit 
       the highest carbon without changing for years, whereas India has changed throughout the years. These statistics 
       can be visually understood through the charts below. "),
