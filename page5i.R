    p("As seen through the various charts in the proceeding tabs, fossil fuel
    carbon emissions have been a rising and stagnant issue for years. Starting
    from the effects of the industrial revolution, the effects of fossil fuel
    emissions have worsened and increased throughout the years. One notable
    insight that we gained through this project was regarding the top ten
    countries in terms of the amount of fossil fuels that they emit since
    1751. The following table lists these countries in order along with their
    total emission amounts:"),

    tableOutput(
      outputId = "table"
    ),

    p("This table was included to display the total number of fossil fuel
    carbon dioxide emissions for the top 10 countries that emitted the most
    between 1751 and 2014. This reveals the countries that have contributed
    the most to climate change through their emission of fossil fuel CO2 over
    the last several centuries. It also shows the exact number of emissions for
    each of these countries. This summary table proves exactly which countries
    need to reduce their fossil fuel carbon dioxide emissions comparative to one
    another. This allows us to also visualize these numbers in a smaller sample
    size. The countries that fit this top 10 list are world leaders in terms
    of their economies, businesses, etc. Therefore, it makes more sense to
    compare them to one another rather than every other world country, which
    this table satisfies. According to the table, the United States of America
    emit the most amount of fossil fuel CO2 in the world, which we can now use
    to make improvements."),

    p("Another notable insight that we gained through this project was the
    drastic increase in fossil fuel carbon dioxide emissions in the last
    5 years specifically. The overall emissions increased by 604,809, a
    number only projected to continue to increase in the following years.
    The following bar chart shows this increase:"),

    plotOutput(
      outputId = "year_plot"
    ),

    p("This chart demonstrates how climate change has steadily increased
    even in as little time as the last 5 years. This information can be
    used to predict how these numbers will continue to increase in the
    future years. The last 5 years is also the most current data, which
    is a good predictor of the current climate in the world. This can
    serve as an indicator for the amount of work that needs to be done
    to mitigate the effects of climate change. This also serves as a
    warning for the world to start making efforts to reduce their fossil
    fuel emissions as a way of avoiding climate change as much as possible."),

    p("The final notable insight that we gained through this project was
    regarding the top 10 countries in terms of the amount of fossil fuel
    carbon dioxide they emitted in the year 2014 alone. The following chart
    looks at a breakdown of each carbon emitting source in relation to the
    total for the top 10 carbon emitting countries in the most recent year
    available, which happens to be 2014 for this dataset:"),

    plotOutput(
      outputId = "country_plot"
    ),

    p("Through our analysis it has been apparent that the biggest contributing
    fuel to carbon emissions in the top ten emitting countries in 2014 has been
    solid fuel. This being the most up to date information about the fuel that
    contributes the most to carbon emissions confirms that to change these
    patterns this is the fuel that needs to be targeted as it is seen through
    the most recent data. Of these top ten countries, China, the United States,
    and India tend to be the highest at using solid fuels to emit carbon
    into the atmosphere. This could be due to the fact that both India,
    China, and US are highly populated countries that need a large supply
    of fuel to meet the need, therefore they have resided to the most easy
    to access and least expensive source of fossil fuel. Of these top ten
    countries emitting the most carbon,the top five countries that have the
    highest rate of total change in fossil fuel use continue to be China and
    the United States. This essentially indicates that these two countries emit
    the highest carbon without changing for years, whereas India has changed
    throughout the years. This information ultiamtely shows which types of fuel
    are having the greatest impact on climate change in each of the top 10
    countries. This serves as an indication for what types of fuel emissions
    specifically need to be reduced by which exact countries in order to best
    avoid climate change."),
